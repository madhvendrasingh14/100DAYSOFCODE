#100DaysofCode

**I'm embarking on a 100-day coding adventure!  **

Here's the game plan:

Coding every day for at least an hour. Consistency is key to building habits and skills.
Documenting my progress with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Sharing my journey with the community keeps me accountable and motivated.
Charting my progress visually. Seeing my growth is super satisfying!
Celebrating milestones along the way! Small wins deserve big cheers!
**Wish me luck! **

**I'm excited to see how much I can learn and grow in 100 days! **
